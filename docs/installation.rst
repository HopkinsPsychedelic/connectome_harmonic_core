External Dependencies
---------------------

* ``CHAP`` is written using Python (TODO: version) or above

If you have set up your environment manually (bullet one), you are ready to execute ``CHAP`` via the command line using the `entrypoint script`_ within the directory associated with the CHAP `Github repository`_. The command-line options for ``CHAP`` are documented in the :ref:`usage` section. 

``CHAP`` conforms to the BIDS_ recommended user interface formatting, specifically: 
::$ python entrypoint_script.py <input_bids_path> <derivatives_path> <analysis_level> <named_options> (TODO: check if this is correct)
